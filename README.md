#Arduino project one.
 i am practsing playing with leds and resistors.
 this is like the most basic steps of getting started with arduino.
 
 I want to use a variable resistor (potentialmeter) to control the brightness of an array of leds.
 As i turn the potentialmeter, say clockwise, the leds light from right to left. When i change the rotation to anti clockwise, the leds switch off from left to right.
